FROM tbl_enrolment AS e 

inner Join tbl_schedule AS c

ON e.subjectid = s.id

"CONCAT( P.LNAME, ' ', 'P.FIRSTNAME')"

SUBSTRING(p.fname. 1,1) (Choose only the First name AND then how many characaters to splice)

UCASE() to make everything inside upper case


SELECT 
    
    CONCAT (p.lname, ' '. 'p.firstname ) AS name (optional if you want to arrange certain strings) i think (AS is important)
    p.lname AS name, (you can use AS anywhere just to alias the names for shortcut)
    p.gender,
    pl.code
